# reading_in_color
Developed for our "training synesthesia" experiment
This code was made to work in Microsoft Office (and should also work in Excel, although it has not been verified). 

There are several variations of the basic code provided:

(1) In the published version of the experiment, 4 letters were selected to have 4 colors for a single individual (100% consistent).

(2) The alphabet of one developmental synesthete is given as an example of genuine synesthesia. 

(3) In unpublished experiments, I varied the consistency of the colored letters (at 25%, 50%, 75%). For example, 'a' is red 75% of the time, and for the other 25% of occurences of 'a' one of the other 3 colors is randomly drawn. Please note that the 'inconsistent' versions of this code take a long time to run on novel-length documents (~40,000 words or more). I was only able to successfully run these on a MAC computer (not a DELL PC). (If anyone can optimize this code, please contribute!)
