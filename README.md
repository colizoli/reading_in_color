# reading_in_color
## Developed for our "training synesthesia" experiments.
This code was made to work in Microsoft Word (and should also work in Excel, although it has not been verified). 

### There are several variations of the basic code provided:

(1) In the published version of the experiment, 4 letters were selected to have 4 colors for a single individual (100% consistent).

(2) The alphabet of one developmental synesthete, [Caitlin Gianniny](http://caitlingianniny.com), is given as an example of genuine synesthesia. Her personal website is a good source of information about her own synesthesia, as well as synesthesia related to art and society.

(3) In unpublished experiments, I varied the consistency of the colored letters (at 25% and 75%). For example, 'a' is red 75% of the time, and for the other 25% of occurences of 'a' one of the other 3 colors is randomly drawn. Please note that the 'inconsistent' versions of this code take a long time to run on novel-length documents (~40,000 words or more). I was only able to successfully run these on a MAC computer (not a DELL PC). (If anyone can optimize this code, please contribute!)

Email me if you would like a copy of a closed access publication. 

I would like to acknowledge Nick Daems for help with the first version of the Letters2Colors VB code.
